// In your JavaScript console, execute the following two lines of code to check
// whether their return values differ and if so, how. Take a look at the MDN
// documentation on equality comparisons to read about how == and === differ.

'8' == 8;
// true (standard/abstract equality): one of the value types is coerced to the other one)

'8' === 8;
// false (strict equality): no type conversion

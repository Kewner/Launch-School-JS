// This will raise a ReferenceError, because the if block tries to use the
// a variable before declaring it. Because of the temporal dead zone, the
// declaration of a is hoisted to the top of the scope, but it doesn't have
// a value, not even undefined. 

// LS explanation:
// Your initial hunch might have been that this code should output the numbers 1
// (on line 5) and 2 (on line 7). The reason that doesn't happen is that variables
// declared by let aren't available until the code runs. Therefore, the let
// statement on line 6 creates a new variable a that isn't available on line 5.
// Since we try to log a before assigning it a value, a ReferenceError is raised.

// Technically, the scope of a is the entire block. JavaScript does hoist the
// variables defined by let, but, when it does, it creates a "temporal dead zone"
// in which the variable exists but doesn't have a value -- not even a value of
// undefined. We talk more about the temporal dead zone in a later course.

// Note that the variable a defined on line 6 shadows the variable a defined
// on line 2.

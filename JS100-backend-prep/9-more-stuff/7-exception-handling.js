// What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

// It's a way to catch predicted errors and take action on it, so that the 
// program doesn't have to fail and stop executing.

// LS solution:
// Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable and
// predictable manner. It uses the try/catch statement to catch exceptions that
// the code in the try block raises, and lets the programmer deal with the
// problem in a way that makes sense and perhaps prevents a catastrophic
// failure or nasty bug.
